=== CHANGES MADE ===
Aside from the separation of classes into separate files, only one change 
was made to the game code in order to improve testing, namely an exception
for entering a board position that didn't correspond to any of the dict keys 
(ex. letters like "Q", which was used in testing). This was included as a
potential edge case that needed addressing, both in execution and in testing.
